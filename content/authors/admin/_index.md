I am a researcher in the field of cyber physical physical system security and am currently persuing a Ph.D. at Georgia Tech's College of Computing specializing in cybersecurity. My research aims to protect a system from cyber attacks by leveraging physical aspects of cyber-physical systems and the power of software diversity. I'm dedicated to creating resilient real-time systems that not only defend against cyber-attacks but also adapt gracefully in the face of irregular or faulty behavior. My research interests include embedded systems, compilers and program analysis. I am working under Dr. Sukarno Mertoguno at the CSAFA lab of Security Research.
